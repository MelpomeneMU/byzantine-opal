## +name

> +name &lt;name> - find every name matching that string
> +name/claim &lt;name> - if the player has been gone long enough, claim their name for yourself.
> +vacation &lt;note> - set yourself on vacation. It will be removed when you log in next. This extends the period you can keep your name from 30 days to 180 days. If you still haven't logged in by 180 days, and someone wants your name, they can have it. Your vacation note will show up in your +finger.
