# byzantine-opal

The goal of this repo is to put together a minimal, bare-bones MUcode framework for TinyMUX 2.12. I'll be avoiding game-system-specific things, but encouraging default functionality that updates and replaces aging code like SGP Globals. Some of the SGP functionality will probably end up dropped entirely.

This will NOT include things like Myrddin's BBS and the Anomaly Jobs framework; at best, I'll link to them here in this README. The purpose of this is to gather original or universal-but-unpublished code.

Some code will be from my other repository, arbitrary-rainbow, and will be hopefully more generic and flexible.

As always, code should be drop-in ready with minimal editing unless in-progress, and documentation will be included with the files.
