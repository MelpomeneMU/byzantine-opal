# Goals

The goal of this repo is to get a game from "literally nothing coded" to at least halfway usable with a standardized interface which is highly and easily customizable.

This file is also intended to replace and supplant the SGP Globals which come by default with MUX. It's probably best if you install this on a brand new game and remove or disable the standard globals since they could conflict with this code.

## Functions

**The following functions are cribbed from SGP Globals but updated:**

> isstaff() - allow access if someone is a staffer (now takes into account non-bitted staffers)

> secs2hrs() - functionality updated to return durations in years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, but only the first two intervals.

**Some additional functions that are my own work:**

> interval() - return a duration between two timestamps in seconds

> title() - a properly cased title which honors the case given by the sentence author: title(a book about the iPad by the BBC) will produce "A Book About the iPad by the BBC". (Note, this is different functionality from the titlestr() function of Thenomain's GMCCG - that was designed to turn all-caps words like "COOKING" into title-cased "Cooking". This would keep the original word's case.)

> header() and wheader()
> divider(), subheader(), and wdivider()
> footer() and wfooter()

> formattext() - wrap the text up with your default margins and borders

> formatcolumns() - fit tabular data into your default margins and borders

> formattable() - tabular data, optionally with a header, you choose the number of columns

> formatdb() - tabular data straight out of a database, columns determined by the number returned. (Designed to work with the output of SQL Commands.mu.)

> multicol() - lay out tabular data where you want to specify column widths, either as a percentage or explicit widths. Includes the ability to designate "fill" columns - * means "let this column take up all the remaining available space" - and percentage columns (type '12p' instead of '12').

> themecolors() - returns the theme's colors so you can use them in other code without having to hardcode a reference.

> indent() - returns the standard indent.

The following functions are useful for developers:

> debug(obj, message) - sends a message to the chosen debugger (hard-coded in a setting below so that your debugs have no chance of escaping) only if debugging is turned on for that object. You can turn debugging off and on with debug(obj).

> report(obj, message) - sends a report automatically to a hard-coded target, either a dbref or a channel. I use this for SQL failures, which I always want to know about, and send them to the staff channel.

## Room Parents

This set of commands includes a custom room parent for IC and OOC rooms as well as basic commands for switching to the new parents:

> +roomparent - show which room parent the room is parented to
> +roomparent ooc or ic - parent the room to the OOC or IC room parent
> +dig/ooc <room name> and +dig/ic <room name> - dig a new room parented to the given room parents.

## Commands

**Commands from SGP I will be duplicating:**

> +motd
> ooc and '
> +ooc/+ic
> +staff and +staff/all, +staff/add and +staff/remove
> +view
> +glance
> +duty
> +dark
> +join <name> and +rjoin or +return or something cuz I always forgot that command
> +summon <name> and +rsummon or +return <name>
> +selfboot

**Stuff I will not be duplicating at this time:**

> places - this would be its own thing if I created it and would not require fancy setup if I could avoid it
> +beginner - I have never seen a beginner make use of this.
> +info - this is going to be game-specific.
> +knock and +shout
> +uptime
> +warn
> +bg

**New commands:**

> +doing
> +doing <text> - cuz some folks forget the @doing syntax (it's not @doing me=<text>, it's @doing <text>), and I think it's easier to remember as a +command.
> +doing/poll <text> - set the poll (staff-only)
> +doing/add <text> - save a @doing to a list
> +doing/list - see your list
> +doing/random - set a random @doing
> +doing/del <number> - delete one from the list

## More to come - this is a work in progress

This repo is expected to change rapidly and frequently.

Command syntax rules:

1. When using a /switch, and then implementing its opposite (for example, /watch), use /un in front of the same word.
2. When using a /switch with multiple clear opposites, such as /add, implement all the opposites you can, such as /delete and /remove.
3. Use full words for switches but shorten as much as possible with * for brevity.

### Command Documentation

Most of the commands below which have flags can be shortened - for example, +who/unhilight can be shortened to +who/unh. The full text is left in for clarity.

#### +who

> +who
> +3who - a 3-column +who.
> +2who - a 2-column +who.
> +who/columns <list> - change the columns shown on +who. Leave blank to reset.
> +who/sort <list>
> +who * - search for specific player
> +who/watch <name> - see when a player logs in and out, highlight them on the +who list.
> +who/unwatch <name> - unhilight them and stop watching their connects
> +who/hide - don't notify others when you log in or out.
> +who/unhide - allow others to see when you log in or out.
> +who/permit <name> - permit someone to see you when you connect, even when you're hidden.
> +who/unpermit <name> - remove someone from your permitted list.
> +who/note <player>=<note> - make a note so you can remember who a player is
> +who/notes - see all connected players and any notes you have on them
> +who/page <message> - page all your watched players who are connected a message.

#### +watch

+watch is just a slightly specialized function of +who. Most of the commands here are aliases to their equivalent +who commands.

> +watch/list - list all the people you're watching
> +watch - see just the people you have watched
> +watch/add <name> - watch someone's connections/disconnections
> +watch/delete or /remove <name> - stop watching them
> +watch/hide - hide from +watch
> +watch/unhide - become visible to +watch again
> +watch/permit and /unpermit - same as +who/permit and /unpermit.
> +watch/all on or off - see all logins and disconnects.
> +watch/on or /off - turn connect/disconnect notices on or off entirely.
> +watch/page <message> - page all your watched players who are connected a message.

In addition, you can create a custom format using &watchfmt. Here's the standard syntax:

> &watchfmt me=cat(alert(prettytime()), moniker(%0), has, %1.)

And finally, due to backwards compatibility we also included &awatch. It will be triggered whenever someone connects or disconnects.

> &awatch me=think My &awatch: %0 has %1.

#### +staff

> +staff - shows all staff
> +staff/all - included for backwards compatibility, does the same as +staff

##### Staff-only +staff commands

> +staff/add <name>
> +staff/remove or /delete <name>
> +duty - toggle yourself on or off duty
> +dark - toggle yourself visible or dark. Dark staffers don't show up on the +who.

#### +motd

> +motd - see it
> +motd/set <text> - set it (staff only)
> +motd/set staff=<text> - set the staff-only MOTD (staff-only)

#### +doing

> +doing - see yours
> +doing <text> - set yours (does not save it to the list)
> +doing/add <doing> - add a random one to the list to be selected when you log in
> +doing/list - show your list
> +doing/delete <number> - delete one from your list
> +doing/random - set a random one
> +doing/poll <text> - change the poll (staff only)
