# Goals

The goal of this repo is to get a game from "literally nothing coded" to at least halfway usable with a standardized interface which is highly and easily customizable.

This file is also intended to replace and supplant the SGP Globals which come by default with MUX. It's probably best if you install this on a brand new game and remove or disable the standard globals since they could conflict with this code.

## Functions

**The following functions are cribbed from SGP Globals but updated:**

> isstaff() - allow access if someone is a staffer (now takes into account non-bitted staffers)

> secs2hrs() - functionality updated to return durations in years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, but only the first two intervals.

**Some additional functions that are my own work:**

> interval() - return a duration between two timestamps in seconds

> title() - a properly cased title which honors the case given by the sentence author: title(a book about the iPad by the BBC) will produce "A Book About the iPad by the BBC". (Note, this is different functionality from the titlestr() function of Thenomain's GMCCG - that was designed to turn all-caps words like "COOKING" into title-cased "Cooking". This would keep the original word's case.)

> header() and wheader()
> divider(), subheader(), and wdivider()
> footer() and wfooter()

> formattext() - wrap the text up with your default margins and borders

> formatcolumns() - fit tabular data into your default margins and borders

> formattable() - tabular data, optionally with a header, you choose the number of columns

> formatdb() - tabular data straight out of a database, columns determined by the number returned. (Designed to work with the output of SQL Commands.mu.)

> multicol() - lay out tabular data where you want to specify column widths, either as a percentage or explicit widths. Includes the ability to designate "fill" columns - * means "let this column take up all the remaining available space" - and percentage columns (type '12p' instead of '12').

> themecolors() - returns the theme's colors so you can use them in other code without having to hardcode a reference.

> indent() - returns the standard indent.

The following functions are useful for developers:

> debug(obj, message) - sends a message to the chosen debugger (hard-coded in a setting below so that your debugs have no chance of escaping) only if debugging is turned on for that object. You can turn debugging off and on with debug(obj).

> report(obj, message) - sends a report automatically to a hard-coded target, either a dbref or a channel. I use this for SQL failures, which I always want to know about, and send them to the staff channel.

## Room Parents

This set of commands includes a custom room parent for IC and OOC rooms as well as basic commands for switching to the new parents:

> +roomparent - show which room parent the room is parented to
> +roomparent ooc or ic - parent the room to the OOC or IC room parent
> +dig/ooc <room name> and +dig/ic <room name> - dig a new room parented to the given room parents.

## Commands

**Commands from SGP I will be duplicating:**

> +motd
> ooc and '
> +ooc/+ic
> +staff and +staff/all, +staff/add and +staff/remove
> +view
> +glance
> +duty
> +dark
> +join <name> and +rjoin or +return or something cuz I always forgot that command
> +summon <name> and +rsummon or +return <name>
> +selfboot

**Stuff I will not be duplicating at this time:**

> places - this would be its own thing if I created it and would not require fancy setup if I could avoid it
> +beginner - I have never seen a beginner make use of this.
> +info - this is going to be game-specific.
> +knock and +shout
> +uptime
> +warn
> +bg

**New commands:**

> +doing
> +doing <text> - cuz some folks forget the @doing syntax (it's not @doing me=<text>, it's @doing <text>), and I think it's easier to remember as a +command.
> +doing/poll <text> - set the poll (staff-only)
> +doing/add <text> - save a @doing to a list
> +doing/list - see your list
> +doing/random - set a random @doing
> +doing/del <number> - delete one from the list

## More to come - this is a work in progress

This repo is expected to change rapidly and frequently.
